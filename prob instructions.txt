In order to solve a problem dealing with combinations and permutations, you are going to need the formulas shown above. The 'n' represents the total 
number of items there are, and the 'r' represents the number of items selected. The main distinction between these two formulas is that when dealing
with permutations, order matters!! You need to question yourself 'Does order matter?' in order to figure out which formula to use.
In order to apply this to a probability problem, you need to understand what to look for. If you are given a list of 10 letters and are asked to find 
how many words of 3 you can make from those, you should be able to identify that it is a permutation problem. Order counts in this one. 
You can then plug in the 10 as 'n' and the 3 as 'r' and solve the problem. If you are asked the same problem, but can have no repeats, you need to
account for the repeats by making it so only one instance of that letter can be used. If the would given is 'salamander', instead of your expression 
being 10!/(10-3)!, it would be 7!/(7-3)!. Ind ifficult mode, when asked to find the chances of getting the marble a certain number of times, 
you need to account for all of the possibilities. For example, if the question says that 3 marbles are drawn and asks for the chances of at least one 
being a certain color, you will need to the account for all of the possible outcomes, which in this case are 0 marbles being the color you need, 
1, 2, or 3 marbles being the color you need. In this case, you would need to account for 1,2, or 3 marbles, so you would need to find the probabilities
of all 3 and add them to get your final answer. Hint: This can be done faster with the use on combinations. 

To solve a regular probability problem, the way to do it is find the number of ways that the event you are looking for can occur and then divide it by 
the total number of events.
