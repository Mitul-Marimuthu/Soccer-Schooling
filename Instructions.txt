In order to solve a basic trigonometry problem, there are 3 steps you need to know: identify the angle, draw a right triangle and figure out
which leg you need, and calculate the length of that leg. In order to find the angle in standard position, you will need to know
that the initial side of the angle is on the x-axis, and that the terminal side moves counter-clockwise. This means that a 90 degree angle 
will have its initial side on the x-axis, and its terminal side on the y-axis. Once you have located the angle, you will have to 'draw' a vertical
to the x-axis to get the reference angle needed to find the needed value. This makes it so all triangles drawn using the questions given will be right 
and follow a 30-60-90 or a 45-45-90 pattern. Once that is complete, in order to find which leg you need to find, you will need to know these 
6 trig identities:

sin = length of vertical leg
cos = length of horizontal leg
tan = sin/cos
sec = 1/cos
csc = 1/sin 
cot = cos/sin or 1/tan

All of these identies are made possible by the fact that the length of any hypotenuse on the unit circle (shown above) has a length of one unit. All
that is left to do is to calculate the length of the leg using the pattern of 30-60-90 and 45-45-90 triangle, being (x, x sqrt 3, 2x) and (x, x, x sqrt 2)
respectively. Once you this you have your answer. 

BE WARNED: BOTH ANGLES AND LEG LENGTH CAN BE NEGATIVE
