The remaining 2 options are on their own spereate card layouts in order to present a smooth animation and not thorw all the inofrmation out at once
Using the counter variable, it switches cards on the other parts of the gridlayout, presenting the next set of information.
The condionals have >= symbols in case the player chnages their mind later
This is done until all 3 option sets are shown and information is gathered. From that point the user can click the polay buttn to start the game.
