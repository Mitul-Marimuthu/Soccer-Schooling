In most if not all stats problems given by us, the mean and the standard deviation are given. This will help you understand where percentiles are located
For example, you can see that 1 standard deviation to the right from the mean makes up 68% of the area of the curve, meaning that that is the 68th
percentile. The percentiles for the other standard deviations are given. This will be helpful when trying to find what percent of people are in a given
percentile. Otherwise, it is easy to calculate how many standard devations a certain value is from the mean by subtracting the mean from your value, then 
dividing the difference from the standard deviation. 

Sampling - in order to identify the type of sample you need to ask yourself which criteria from the following makes sense:

convenience: only sampling people who are easy to reach

cluster: the population is divided into groups and only one or more groups are sampled

stratified: the population is divided into groups and a number of members form each group are sampled

systematic: using a set rule for samplin (i.e. every 5th person)

self-selected: people volunteer to be sampled



Data collection - ask yourself which of the criteria makes the most sense for what you are trying to find:

experiment: using a treatment group, a control group, and a treatment

observational study: observes individuals and collect data based on their habits

survey: people are asked questions

simulation: using a model to reproduce the conditions of a situation
